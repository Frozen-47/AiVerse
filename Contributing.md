## 🛠️ Setting Up Your Local Environment

Follow these steps to run the AiVerse project on your local machine:

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18.0.0 or higher recommended)
- **Git**

### 2. Fork and Clone
First, [fork the repository](https://github.com/Frozen-47/AiVerse) to your own GitHub account, then clone it locally:
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AiVerse.git

# Move into the project directory
cd AiVerse
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. You can copy the following template and replace the values with your Supabase credentials:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-supabase-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-public-anon-key
```
> [!NOTE]
> If you are working on the backend AI Chat Widget (`api/chat.ts`), you will also need a **Groq API Key** configured in your local environment as `GROQ_API_KEY`.

### 5. Start the Development Server
Run the local Vite server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view the application.

## 🚀 Git Workflow

Please follow this structured process to submit changes:

1. **Keep Synced**: Ensure your `main` branch is up to date with the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. **Branch Names**: Create a clean feature branch with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   # For new features
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   
   # For bug fixes
   git checkout -b bugfix/your-bugfix-name
   ```
3. **Commit Guidelines**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages following the conventional format:
   - `feat: add compare arena page title and layout divider`
   - `fix: resolve command-k shortcut input blur issue`
   - `docs: update setup steps in contributing guide`
4. **Push & PR**: Push your changes to your fork and submit a Pull Request:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. **Request Review**: Open a PR against the `main` branch of the official repository. Provide a description of the changes and any visual previews (screenshots/GIFs) if you altered UI elements.

## 📏 Code Style Guidelines

- **TypeScript Strictness**: Always write explicit types and interfaces. Do not use `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- **Tailwind CSS v4 Style Utility**: Maintain clean inline classes using Tailwind CSS v4 styling rules. Leverage utility combinations in `index.css` for recurrent complex components (e.g. `.glass-search`, `.glow-card`).
- **Code Linters**: Run `npm run lint` before committing to catch any static analysis issues. Ensure your changes compile clean by running `npm run build` locally.

## 🤝 Code of Conduct

- **Be Respectful**: Encourage and support other contributors. Code reviews should be constructive and polite.
- **Accurate Submissions**: Ensure all new encyclopedia entries include correct citations and factual summaries. Do not submit spam or promotional placeholders.
